# RT-Toolkit

RT-Toolkit is an offline-friendly mobile reference and training app for respiratory therapists, students and clinical preceptors. The project uses [Expo](https://expo.dev) with React Native so the same codebase runs on Android, iOS and web.

## Features

- **Clinical Reference** – calculators and an ABG interpretation helper. Calculation history is stored locally for offline access.
- **Preceptor Tools** – simple student tracker to log observations during clinical rotations.
- **Procedural Guides** – step-by-step checklists for common bedside procedures.
- **Education** – lightweight quiz module for exam prep.

The app is designed to be easily extended with more content and tools in future updates.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

The app can be opened in an Android emulator, iOS simulator or Expo Go.
